## ‚úÖ What problem does this solve?
Say you have a popup you want to show to every user, daily for a week. Users can dismiss it and it should not show up again for the rest of the day until the next day.

This packages handles the complex logic regarding whether the (dismissible) popup should be visible to the current user at the current moment. It basically handles the visibility of your dismissible. It's highly customizable, making it very flexible for many scenario's.

Because it's serverside we can easily get statistics like who dismissed what, when and where.

## üì¶ Installation
1. Require the package in your Laravel application
```shell
composer require rellix/dismissibles-for-laravel
```

2. Run the migrations to create the database tables
```shell
php artisan migrate
```

## ‚ùì How to use

### 1. Add the interface and trait to any model
```php
use Rellix\Dismissibles\Contracts\Dismisser;
use Rellix\Dismissibles\Traits\HasDismissibles;

class User implements Dismisser
{
    use HasDismissibles;
    
    ...
}

```

### 2. Create a dismissible (migration)
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Date;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;

return new class () extends Migration {
    public function up(): void
    {
        DB::table('dismissibles')->insert([
            'name'         => 'Test Popup', // This is your **unique** identifier
            'active_from'  => Date::createFromFormat('d-m-Y', '01-03-2024'),
            'active_until' => null, // Optional end date
            'created_at'   => Date::now(),
            'updated_at'   => Date::now(),
        ]);
    }
};
```

and run your created migration:
```php
php artisan migrate
```

<details>

<summary>üí° You can also create/fetch a Dismissible inline using the "active"-scope and "firstOrCreate".</summary>

```php
Dismissible::active()->firstOrCreate(
    ['name' => 'Test Popup'], 
    [
        'active_from'  => Date::createFromFormat('d-m-Y', '01-03-2024'),
        'active_until' => null,
        'created_at'   => Date::now(),
        'updated_at'   => Date::now(),
    ]
);
```

</details>

### 3. Check if it should be visible at the current moment
```php
use Rellix\Dismissibles\Facades\Dismissibles;

$showPopup = Dismissibles::shouldBeVisible('Test Popup', $user);

// Here are some more examples, including ones with additional conditionals:
$showPopup = Dismissibles::shouldBeVisible('Happy New Year 2025 Popup', $user);
$showPopup = Dismissibles::shouldBeVisible('Newsletter signup modal', $user) && !$user->is_subscribed;
$showPopup = Dismissibles::shouldBeVisible('Complete your profile notification', $user) && !$user->has_completed_profile;
$showPopup = Dismissibles::shouldBeVisible('50% Off First Purchase Popup', $user) && !$user->has_orders;
```

<details>

<summary>üí° You can also use the individual models.</summary>

```php
use Rellix\Dismissibles\Facades\Dismissibles;

$popup = Dismissibles::get('Test Popup');

$showPopup = $popup->shouldBeVisibleTo($user);

// You can also get all Dismissibles that should be visible. Useful for performance reasons.
$dismissibles = Dismissibles::getAllFor($user);
```

</details>

### 4. Dismiss it for a specified period
```php
use Rellix\Dismissibles\Facades\Dismissibles;

Dismissibles::dismiss('Test Popup', $user)->untilNextWeek();

// Here's an overview of all the ways you can dismiss:
Dismissibles::dismiss('Test Popup', $user)
    ->untilTomorrow();
    ->untilNextWeek();
    ->untilNextMonth();
    ->untilNextQuarter();
    ->untilNextYear();
    ->until($dateTime);
    ->forHours($numberOfHours);
    ->forDays($numberOfDays);
    ->forWeeks($numberOfWeeks);
    ->forMonths($numberOfMonths);
    ->forYears($numberOfYears);
    ->forever();
```

<details>

<summary>üí° You can also use the individual models.</summary>

```php
use Rellix\Dismissibles\Facades\Dismissibles;

$popup = Dismissibles::get('Test Popup');

// Here's an overview of all the ways you can dismiss:
$popup->dismissFor($user)
    ->untilTomorrow();
    ->untilNextWeek();
    ->untilNextMonth();
    ->untilNextQuarter();
    ->untilNextYear();
    ->until($dateTime);
    ->forHours($numberOfHours);
    ->forDays($numberOfDays);
    ->forWeeks($numberOfWeeks);
    ->forMonths($numberOfMonths);
    ->forYears($numberOfYears);
    ->forever();
```

</details>

## ‚ùó Good to know
- The facade contains some oneliners by `$name`, but you can also use the scopes/methods in the `Dismissible` and `Dismissal` Eloquent models as you wish for ultimate flexibility.
- It's recommended to centralize dismissible names in an enum (or config)
- Need extra data regarding the dismissal? All dismiss methods allow you to pass an `$extraData` array as last parameter which will be written to the `dismissals` table as json.
- Feel free to request more methods/scopes

## üíæ Database tables
The database structure allows you to easily track activity regarding dismissibles. Due to the `extra_data` column it's also very flexible!
